/**
 * @brief Create Profile Configuration. A profile is bound to an agent but can
 *        be used across many contexts. The profile has a fixed set of counters
 *        that are collected (and specified by counter_list). The available
 *        counters for an agent can be queried using
 *        @ref rocprofiler_iterate_agent_supported_counters. An existing profile
 *        may be supplied via config_id to use as a base for the new profile.
 *        All counters in the existing profile will be copied over to the new
 *        profile. The existing profile will remain unmodified and usable with
 *        the new profile id being returned in config_id.
 *
 * @param [in] agent_id Agent identifier
 * @param [in] counters_list List of GPU counters
 * @param [in] counters_count Size of counters list
 * @param [in,out] config_id Identifier for GPU counters group. If an existing
                   profile is supplied, that profiles counters will be copied
