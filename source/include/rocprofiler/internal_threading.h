/**
 * @brief Invoke this function to receive callbacks before and after the creation of an internal
 * thread by a library which as invoked on the thread which is creating the internal thread(s).
 *
 * Use the @ref rocprofiler_runtime_library_t enumeration for specifying which libraries you want
 * callbacks before and after the library creates an internal thread. These callbacks will be
 * invoked on the thread that is about to create the new thread (not on the newly created thread).
 * In thread-aware tools that wrap pthread_create, this can be used to disable the wrapper before
 * the pthread_create invocation and re-enable the wrapper afterwards. In many cases, tools will
 * want to ignore the thread(s) created by rocprofiler since these threads do not exist in the
 * normal application execution, whereas the internal threads for HSA, HIP, etc. are created in
 * normal application execution; however, the HIP, HSA, etc. internal threads are typically
 * background threads which just monitor kernel completion and are unlikely to contribute to any
 * performance issues. Please note that the postcreate callback is guaranteed to be invoked after
 * the underlying system call to create a new thread but it does not guarantee that the new thread
 * has been started. Please note, that once these callbacks are registered, they cannot be removed
 * so the caller is responsible for ignoring these callbacks if they want to ignore them beyond a
 * certain point in the application.
 *
 * @param [in] precreate Callback invoked immediately before a new internal thread is created
 * @param [in] postcreate Callback invoked immediately after a new internal thread is created
 * @param [in] libs Bitwise-or of libraries, e.g. `ROCPROFILER_LIBRARY | ROCPROFILER_MARKER_LIBRARY`
 * means the callbacks will be invoked whenever rocprofiler and/or the marker library create
 * internal threads but not when the HSA or HIP libraries create internal threads.
 * @param [in] data Data shared between callbacks
 * @return ::rocprofiler_status_t
 * @retval ::ROCPROFILER_STATUS_SUCCESS There are currently no conditions which result in any other
 * value, even if internal threads have already been created
