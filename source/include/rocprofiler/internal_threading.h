/**
 * @brief Enumeration for specifying which libraries you want callbacks before and after the library
 * creates an internal thread. These callbacks will be invoked on the thread that is about to create
 * the new thread (not on the newly created thread). In thread-aware tools that wrap pthread_create,
 * this can be used to disable the wrapper before the pthread_create invocation and re-enable the
 * wrapper afterwards. In many cases, tools will want to ignore the thread(s) created by rocprofiler
 * since these threads do not exist in the normal application execution, whereas the internal
 * threads for HSA, HIP, etc. are created in normal application execution; however, the HIP, HSA,
 * etc. internal threads are typically background threads which just monitor kernel completion and
 * are unlikely to contribute to any performance issues.
