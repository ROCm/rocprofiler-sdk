  description: Count number of waves sent <16 active threads sent to SQs. (per-simd, emulated, global).
    This value represents the number of waves that an each individual SIMD has enqueued during the collection
    timeframe (for dispatch profiling this is the timeframe of kernel execution, for agent profiling it
    is the timeframe between start_context and read counter data) with less than 16 threads. A sum of
    all SQ_WAVES_LT_16 values will give the total number of waves with 16 threads enqueued during the
    collection timeframe by the application. Returns one value per-SE (aggregates of SIMD values). Useful
    for checking for wavefront occupancy.

    between start_context and read counter data). Context saving/restoring is a slow operation and should
    be limited. High values can also indicate that stalling may be taking place (waiting for free register
