# Installation

This document provides information required to install ROCprofiler-SDK from source.

## Supported systems

ROCprofiler-SDK is supported only on Linux. The following distributions are tested:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04
- OpenSUSE 15.4
- RedHat 8.8

ROCprofiler-SDK might operate as expected on other [Linux distributions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-operating-systems), but has not been tested.

### Identifying the operating system

To identify the Linux distribution and version, see the `/etc/os-release` and `/usr/lib/os-release` files:

```shell
$ cat /etc/os-release
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
ID=ubuntu
...
VERSION_ID="20.04"
...
```

The relevant fields are `ID` and the `VERSION_ID`.

## Build requirements

Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.21 (or later).

:::{note}
If the `CMake` installed on the system is too old, you can install a new version using various methods. One of the easiest options is to use PyPi (Pythonâ€™s pip).
:::

```bash
pip install --user 'cmake==3.22.0'
export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}
```
## Building ROCprofiler-SDK

```bash
git clone https://git@github.com:ROCm/rocprofiler-sdk.git rocprofiler-sdk-source  
cmake                                         \
      -B rocprofiler-sdk-build                \
      -D ROCPROFILER_BUILD_TESTS=ON           \
      -D ROCPROFILER_BUILD_SAMPLES=ON         \
      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/rocm       \
       rocprofiler-sdk-source

cmake --build rocprofiler-sdk-build --target all --parallel 8  
```

## Installing ROCprofiler-SDK

To install ROCprofiler-SDK from the `rocprofiler-sdk-build` directory, run:

```bash
