# rocprofv3 User Guide

ROCProfiler SDK is a tooling infrastructure for profiling general-purpose GPU compute applications running on the ROCm platform. It supports application tracing to provide a big picture of the GPU application execution and kernel profiling to provide low-level hardware details from the performance counters.

The ROCProfiler SDK library provides runtime-independent APIs for tracing runtime calls and asynchronous activities such as GPU kernel dispatches and memory moves. The tracing includes callback APIs for runtime API tracing and activity APIs for asynchronous activity records logging. You can use these APIs to develop a tracing tool or implement tracing in the application.

This document discusses the command-line tool `rocprofv3` in detail. It is based on the APIs from the ROCProfiler SDK library.

## Usage

`rocprofv3` is a CLI tool that helps you quickly optimize applications and understand the low-level kernel details without requiring any modification in the source code. It is being developed to be backward compatible with its predecessor, `rocprof`, and to provide more features to help users profile their applications with better accuracy.

The following sections demonstrate the use of `rocprofv3` for application tracing and kernel profiling using various command-line options.

`rocprofv3` is installed with ROCm under `/opt/rocm/bin`. To use the tool from anywhere in the system, export `PATH` variable:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rocm/bin
```

Before you can start tracing or profiling your HIP application using `rocprofv3`, build the application using:

```bash
cmake -B <build-directory> <source-directory> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/rocm

cmake --build <build-directory> --target all --parallel <N>
```

### Options

Below is the list of `rocprofv3` command-line options. Some options are used for application tracing and some for kernel profiling while the output control options control the presentation and redirection of the generated output.

You can also see all the `rocprofv3` options using:

```bash
rocprofv3 --help
```

### Application tracing

Application tracing provides the big picture of a program’s execution by collecting data on the execution times of API calls and GPU commands, such as kernel execution, async memory copy, and barrier packets. This information can be used as the first step in the profiling process to answer important questions, such as how much percentage of time was spent on memory copy and which kernel took the longest time to execute.

To use `rocprofv3` for application tracing, run:

```bash
rocprofv3 <tracing_option> -- <app_relative_path>
```

#### HIP trace

HIP trace comprises execution traces for the entire application at the HIP level. This includes HIP API functions and their asynchronous activities at the runtime level. In general, HIP APIs directly interact with the user program. It is easier to analyze HIP traces as you can directly map them to the program.

To trace HIP runtime APIs, use:

```bash
rocprofv3 --hip-trace -- < app_relative_path >
```

**Note: The tracing and counter colleciton options generates an additional agent info file.

The above command generates a `hip_api_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

```bash
$ cat 238_hip_api_trace.csv

```

To trace HIP compile time APIs, use:

```bash
rocprofv3 --hip-compiler-trace -- < app_relative_path >
```

The above command generates a `hip_api_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

```bash

```

#### HSA trace

The HIP runtime library is implemented with the low-level HSA runtime. HSA API tracing is more suited for advanced users who want to understand the application behavior at the lower level. In general, tracing at the HIP level is recommended for most users. You should use HSA trace only if you are familiar with HSA runtime.

HSA trace contains the start and end time of HSA runtime API calls and their asynchronous activities.

```bash
rocprofv3 --hsa-trace -- < app_relative_path >
```

The above command generates a `hsa_api_trace.csv` file prefixed with process ID.
Note: the contents of this file have been truncated for demonstration purposes.

```bash
$ cat 197_hsa_api_trace.csv

"Domain","Function","Process_Id","Thread_Id","Correlation_Id","Start_Timestamp","End_Timestamp"

#### Marker trace

In certain situations, such as debugging performance issues in large-scale GPU programs, API-level tracing may be too fine-grained to provide a big picture of the program execution. In such cases, defining specific tasks to be traced is helpful.

To specify the tasks for tracing, enclose the respective source code with the API calls provided by the ROCTX library. This process is also known as instrumentation. As the scope of code for instrumentation is defined using the enclosing API calls, it is called a range. A range is a programmer-defined task that has a well-defined start and end code scope. You can also fine-grained the scope specified within a range using further nested ranges. The `rocprofv3` tool also reports the timelines for these nested ranges.

Here is a list of useful APIs for code instrumentation.

- `roctxMark`: Inserts a marker in the code with a message. Creating marks can help you see when a line of code is executed.
- `roctxRangeStart`: Starts a range. Different threads can start ranges.
- `roctxRangePush`: Starts a new nested range.
- `roctxRangePop`: Stops the current nested range.
- `roctxRangeStop`: Stops the given range.

See how to use `rocTX` APIs in the MatrixTranspose application below:

```bash
roctxMark("before hipLaunchKernel");
int rangeId = roctxRangeStart("hipLaunchKernel range");
roctxRangePush("hipLaunchKernel");

// Launching kernel from host
hipLaunchKernelGGL(matrixTranspose, dim3(WIDTH/THREADS_PER_BLOCK_X, WIDTH/THREADS_PER_BLOCK_Y), dim3(THREADS_PER_BLOCK_X, THREADS_PER_BLOCK_Y), 0,0,gpuTransposeMatrix,gpuMatrix, WIDTH);

roctxMark("after hipLaunchKernel");

// Memory transfer from device to host
roctxRangePush("hipMemcpy");

hipMemcpy(TransposeMatrix, gpuTransposeMatrix, NUM * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyDeviceToHost);

roctxRangePop();  // for "hipMemcpy"
roctxRangePop();  // for "hipLaunchKernel"
roctxRangeStop(rangeId);
```

To trace the API calls enclosed within the range, use:

```bash
rocprofv3 --marker-trace -- < app_relative_path >
```

Running the above command generates a `marker_api_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

```bash
$ cat 210_marker_api_trace.csv

"Domain","Function","Process_Id","Thread_Id","Correlation_Id","Start_Timestamp","End_Timestamp"
"MARKER_CORE_API","before hipLaunchKernel",717,717,1,1520113899312225,1520113899312225
"MARKER_CORE_API","after hipLaunchKernel",717,717,4,1520113900128482,1520113900128482
"MARKER_CORE_API","hipMemcpy",717,717,5,1520113900141100,1520113901483408
"MARKER_CORE_API","hipLaunchKernel",717,717,3,1520113899684965,1520113901491622
"MARKER_CORE_API","hipLaunchKernel range",717,0,2,1520113899682208,1520113901495882
```

For the description of the fields in the output file, see [Output file fields](#output-file-fields).

#### Kernel trace

To trace kernel dispatch traces, use:

```bash
rocprofv3 --kernel-trace -- < app_relative_path >
```

The above command generates a `kernel_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

```bash
$ cat 199_kernel_trace.csv

"Kind","Agent_Id","Queue_Id","Kernel_Id","Kernel_Name","Correlation_Id","Start_Timestamp","End_Timestamp","Private_Segment_Size","Group_Segment_Size","Workgroup_Size_X","Workgroup_Size_Y","Workgroup_Size_Z","Grid_Size_X","Grid_Size_Y","Grid_Size_Z"
"KERNEL_DISPATCH",1,139690710949888,15,"matrixTranspose(float*, float*, int)",0,671599758568,671599825328,0,0,4,4,1,1024,1024,1
```

To describe the fields in the output file, see [Output file fields](#output-file-fields).

#### Memory copy trace

To trace memory moves across the application, use:

```bash
rocprofv3 –-memory-copy-trace -- < app_relative_path >
```

The above command generates a `memory_copy_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

```bash
$ cat 197_memory_copy_trace.csv

"Kind","Direction","Source_Agent_Id","Destination_Agent_Id","Correlation_Id","Start_Timestamp","End_Timestamp"
"MEMORY_COPY","HOST_TO_DEVICE",0,1,0,14955949675563,14955950239443
"MEMORY_COPY","DEVICE_TO_HOST",1,0,0,14955952733485,14955953315285
```

To describe the fields in the output file, see [Output file fields](#output-file-fields).

#### Sys trace

This is an all-inclusive option to collect all the above-mentioned traces.

```bash
rocprofv3 –-sys-trace -- < app_relative_path >
```

Running the above command generates `hip_api_trace.csv`, `hsa_api_trace.csv`, `kernel_trace.csv`, `memory_copy_trace.csv`, and `marker_api_trace.csv` (if `rocTX` APIs are specified in the application) files prefixed with the process Id.

#### Scratch Memory Trace

This command collects scratch memory operations traces. Scratch is an address space on AMD GPUs that is roughly equivalent to “local memory” in CUDA (i.e., thread-local global memory with interleaved addressing) that is used for register spills/stack space. rocprof
traces when the rocr runtime allocates, frees, and tries to reclaim scratch memory.

```bash
rocprofv3 --scratch-memory-trace < app_relative_path >
```

#### Stats

This command collects statistics of enabled tracing types. If HIP trace is enabled, then statisitics of HIP APIs will be collected

```bash
rocprofv3 --stats --hip-trace  < app_relative_path >
```

The above command generates a `hip_stats.csv`, `hip_api_trace` file prefixed with the process ID.

```bash
$ cat 24189_hip_stats.csv

```

### Kernel profiling

The application tracing functionality allows you to evaluate the duration of kernel execution but is of little help in providing insight into kernel execution details. The kernel profiling functionality allows you to select kernels for profiling and choose the basic counters or derived metrics to be collected for each kernel execution, thus providing a greater insight into kernel execution.

For more information on counters available on MI200, refer to the [MI200 Performance Counters and Metrics](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/conceptual/gpu-arch/mi300-mi200-performance-counters.html).

#### Input file

To collect the desired basic counters or derived metrics, you can just mention them in an input file below. The line consisting of the counter or metric names must begin with `pmc`. We support input file in text(.txt extension), yaml(.yaml/.yml) and json(.json) format.

```bash
$ cat input.txt

pmc: GPUBusy SQ_WAVES
pmc: GRBM_GUI_ACTIVE

OR

$ cat input.json
{
    "metrics": [
      {
        "pmc": ["SQ_WAVES", "GRBM_COUNT", "GUI_ACTIVE"]
      },
      {
        "pmc": ["FETCH_SIZE", "WRITE_SIZE"]
      }
    ]
  }

OR

$ cat input.yaml

metrics:
  - pmc:
      - SQ_WAVES
      - GRBM_COUNT
      - GUI_ACTIVE
      - 'TCC_HIT[1]'
      - 'TCC_HIT[2]'
  - pmc:
      - FETCH_SIZE
      - WRITE_SIZE

```

The GPU hardware resources limit the number of basic counters or derived metrics that can be collected in one run of profiling. If too many counters or metrics are selected, the kernels need to be executed multiple times to collect them. For multi-pass execution, include multiple `pmc` rows in the input file. Counters or metrics in each `pmc` row can be collected in each kernel run.

#### Kernel profiling output

To supply the input file for kernel profiling, use:

```bash
rocprofv3 -i input.txt -- <app_relative_path>
```

Running the above command generates a `./pmc_n/counter_collection.csv` file prefixed with the process ID. For each `pmc` row, a directory `pmc_n` containing a `counter_collection.csv` file is generated, where n = 1 for the first row and so on.

Each row of the CSV file is an instance of kernel execution. Here is a truncated version of the output file from `pmc_1`.

```bash
$ cat pmc_1/218_counter_collection.csv

"Correlation_Id","Dispatch_Id","Agent_Id","Queue_Id","Process_Id","Thread_Id","Grid_Size","Kernel_Name","Workgroup_Size","LDS_Block_Size","Scratch_Size","VGPR_Count","SGPR_Count","Counter_Name","Counter_Value"
0,1,1,139892123975680,5619,5619,1048576,"matrixTranspose(float*, float*, int)",16,0,0,8,16,"SQ_WAVES",65536
```

### Output file fields

The various fields or the columns in the output CSV files generated for application tracing and kernel profiling are described here:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|

### Sample programs

After the ROCm build is installed:

- Sample programs are installed here:

    ```bash
    /opt/rocm/share/rocprofiler-sdk/samples
    ```

- `rocprofv3` tool is installed here:

    ```bash
    /opt/rocm/bin
    ```

To build samples from any directory, run the following:

```bash
cmake -B <build directory> /opt/rocm/share/rocprofiler-sdk/samples -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/rocm

cmake --build <build directory> --target all --parallel 8
```

To run the built samples, `cd` into the `<build directory>` mentioned in the build commands above and run:

```bash
ctest -V
```

**Note:** Running a few of these tests will require pandas and pytest to be installed first.

```bash
/usr/local/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Output Formats

rocprofv3 provides the following output formats:

- CSV (default)
- JSON
- PFTrace

Specification of the output format is via the `--output-format` command-line option. Format selection is case-insensitive
and multiple output formats are supported. Example: `--output-format json` enables JSON output exclusively whereas
`--output-format csv json pftrace` enables all three output formats for the run.

For trace visualization, use the PFTrace format and open the trace in [ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).

### JSON Output Schema

rocprofv3 supports a custom JSON output format designed for programmatic analysis. The schema is optimized for size
while factoring in usability. The JSON output can be generated via the `--output-format json` command-line option.
