======================
Using rocprofv3
======================

``rocprofv3`` is a CLI tool that helps you quickly optimize applications and understand the low-level kernel details without requiring any modification in the source code.
It's backward compatible with its predecessor, ``rocprof``, and provides more features for application profiling with better accuracy.

The following sections demonstrate the use of ``rocprofv3`` for application tracing and kernel profiling using various command-line options.

``rocprofv3`` is installed with ROCm under ``/opt/rocm/bin``. To use the tool from anywhere in the system, export ``PATH`` variable:

.. code-block:: bash

  export PATH=$PATH:/opt/rocm/bin

Before you start tracing or profiling your HIP application using ``rocprofv3``, build the application using:

.. code-block:: bash

  cmake -B <build-directory> <source-directory> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/rocm
  cmake --build <build-directory> --target all --parallel <N>

Options
---------

Here is the list of ``rocprofv3`` command-line options. Some options are used for application tracing and some for kernel profiling while the output control options control the presentation and redirection of the generated output.

Application tracing
---------------------

Application tracing provides the big picture of a program’s execution by collecting data on the execution times of API calls and GPU commands, such as kernel execution, async memory copy, and barrier packets. This information can be used as the first step in the profiling process to answer important questions, such as how much percentage of time was spent on memory copy and which kernel took the longest time to execute.

To use ``rocprofv3`` for application tracing, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 <tracing_option> -- <app_relative_path>

HIP trace
+++++++++++

HIP trace comprises execution traces for the entire application at the HIP level. This includes HIP API functions and their asynchronous activities at the runtime level. In general, HIP APIs directly interact with the user program. It is easier to analyze HIP traces as you can directly map them to the program.

To trace HIP runtime APIs, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 --hip-trace -- < app_relative_path >

The above command generates a `hip_api_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat 238_hip_api_trace.csv

Here are the contents of `hip_api_trace.csv` file:

.. csv-table:: HIP runtime api trace
   :file: /data/hip_compile_trace.csv
   :widths: 10,10,10,10,10,20,20
   :header-rows: 1

To trace HIP compile time APIs, use:

.. code-block:: shell

  rocprofv3 --hip-compiler-trace -- < app_relative_path >

The above command generates a `hip_api_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat 208_hip_api_trace.csv

Here are the contents of `hip_api_trace.csv` file:

.. csv-table:: HIP compile time api trace
   :file: /data/hip_compile_trace.csv
   :widths: 10,10,10,10,10,20,20
   :header-rows: 1

For the description of the fields in the output file, see :ref:`output-file-fields`.

HSA trace
+++++++++++++

The HIP runtime library is implemented with the low-level HSA runtime. HSA API tracing is more suited for advanced users who want to understand the application behavior at the lower level. In general, tracing at the HIP level is recommended for most users. You should use HSA trace only if you are familiar with HSA runtime.

HSA trace contains the start and end time of HSA runtime API calls and their asynchronous activities.

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 --hsa-trace -- < app_relative_path >

The above command generates a `hsa_api_trace.csv` file prefixed with process ID. Note that the contents of this file have been truncated for demonstration purposes.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat 197_hsa_api_trace.csv

Here are the contents of `hsa_api_trace.csv` file:

.. csv-table:: HSA api trace
   :file: /data/hsa_trace.csv
   :widths: 10,10,10,10,10,20,20
   :header-rows: 1

For the description of the fields in the output file, see :ref:`output-file-fields`.

Marker trace
++++++++++++++

In certain situations, such as debugging performance issues in large-scale GPU programs, API-level tracing might be too fine-grained to provide a big picture of the program execution. In such cases, it is helpful to define specific tasks to be traced.

To specify the tasks for tracing, enclose the respective source code with the API calls provided by the `ROCTX` library. This process is also known as instrumentation. As the scope of code for instrumentation is defined using the enclosing API calls, it is called a range. A range is a programmer-defined task that has a well-defined start and end code scope. You can also refine the scope specified within a range using further nested ranges. ``rocprofv3`` also reports the timelines for these nested ranges.

Here is a list of useful APIs for code instrumentation.

- ``roctxMark``: Inserts a marker in the code with a message. Creating marks help you see when a line of code is executed.
- ``roctxRangeStart``: Starts a range. Different threads can start ranges.
- ``roctxRangePush``: Starts a new nested range.
- ``roctxRangePop``: Stops the current nested range.
- ``roctxRangeStop``: Stops the given range.

See how to use `rocTX` APIs in the MatrixTranspose application below:

.. code-block:: bash

  roctxMark("before hipLaunchKernel");
  int rangeId = roctxRangeStart("hipLaunchKernel range");
  roctxRangePush("hipLaunchKernel");

  // Launching kernel from host
  hipLaunchKernelGGL(matrixTranspose, dim3(WIDTH/THREADS_PER_BLOCK_X, WIDTH/THREADS_PER_BLOCK_Y), dim3(THREADS_PER_BLOCK_X, THREADS_PER_BLOCK_Y), 0,0,gpuTransposeMatrix,gpuMatrix, WIDTH);

  roctxMark("after hipLaunchKernel");

  // Memory transfer from device to host
  roctxRangePush("hipMemcpy");

  hipMemcpy(TransposeMatrix, gpuTransposeMatrix, NUM * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  roctxRangePop();  // for "hipMemcpy"
  roctxRangePop();  // for "hipLaunchKernel"
  roctxRangeStop(rangeId);

To trace the API calls enclosed within the range, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  rocprofv3 --marker-trace -- < app_relative_path >

Running the preceding command generates a `marker_api_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat 210_marker_api_trace.csv

Here are the contents of `marker_api_trace.csv` file:

.. csv-table:: Marker api trace
   :file: /data/marker_api_trace.csv
   :widths: 10,10,10,10,10,20,20
   :header-rows: 1

For the description of the fields in the output file, see :ref:`output-file-fields`.

Kernel trace
++++++++++++++

To trace kernel dispatch traces, use:

.. code-block:: shell

  rocprofv3 --kernel-trace -- < app_relative_path >

The above command generates a `kernel_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat 199_kernel_trace.csv

Here are the contents of `kernel_trace.csv` file:

.. csv-table:: Kernel trace
   :file: /data/kernel_trace.csv
   :widths: 10,10,10,10,10,10,20,20,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10
   :header-rows: 1

For the description of the fields in the output file, see :ref:`output-file-fields`.

Memory copy trace
+++++++++++++++++++

To trace memory moves across the application, use:

.. code-block:: shell

  rocprofv3 –-memory-copy-trace -- < app_relative_path >

The above command generates a `memory_copy_trace.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat 197_memory_copy_trace.csv

Here are the contents of `memory_copy_trace.csv` file:

.. csv-table:: Memory copy trace
   :file: /data/memory_copy_trace.csv
   :widths: 10,10,10,10,10,20,20
   :header-rows: 1

For the description of the fields in the output file, see :ref:`output-file-fields`.

Sys trace
+++++++++++

This is an all-inclusive option to collect all the above-mentioned traces.

.. code-block:: shell

  rocprofv3 –-sys-trace -- < app_relative_path >

Running the above command generates `hip_api_trace.csv`, `hsa_api_trace.csv`, `kernel_trace.csv`, `memory_copy_trace.csv`, and `marker_api_trace.csv` (if `rocTX` APIs are specified in the application) files prefixed with the process ID.

Scratch memory trace
++++++++++++++++++++++

This option collects scratch memory operation's traces. Scratch is an address space on AMDGPUs, which is roughly equivalent to the `local memory` in NVIDIA CUDA. The `local memory` in CUDA is a thread-local global memory with interleaved addressing, which is used for register spills or stack space. With this option, you can trace when the ``rocr`` runtime allocates, frees, and tries to reclaim scratch memory.

.. code-block:: shell

  rocprofv3 --scratch-memory-trace -- < app_relative_path >

Stats
++++++++

This option collects statistics for the enabled tracing types. For example, to collect statistics of HIP APIs, when HIP trace is enabled.
A higher percentage in statistics can help user focus on the API/function that has taken the most time:

.. code-block:: shell

  rocprofv3 --stats --hip-trace  -- < app_relative_path >

The above command generates a `hip_stats.csv` and `hip_api_trace` file prefixed with the process ID.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat hip_stats.csv

Here are the contents of `hip_stats.csv` file:

.. csv-table:: HIP stats
   :file: /data/hip_stats.csv
   :widths: 10,10,20,20,10,10,10,10
   :header-rows: 1

For the description of the fields in the output file, see :ref:`output-file-fields`.

Kernel profiling
-------------------

The application tracing functionality allows you to evaluate the duration of kernel execution but is of little help in providing insight into kernel execution details. The kernel profiling functionality allows you to select kernels for profiling and choose the basic counters or derived metrics to be collected for each kernel execution, thus providing a greater insight into kernel execution.

For a comprehensive list of counters available on MI200, see `MI200 performance counters and metrics <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/conceptual/gpu-arch/mi300-mi200-performance-counters.html>`_.

Input file
++++++++++++

To collect the desired basic counters or derived metrics or tracing, mention them in an input file. The input file could be in text (.txt), yaml (.yaml/.yml), or JSON (.json) format.

In the input text file, the line consisting of the counter or metric names must begin with ``pmc``.
The number of basic counters or derived metrics that can be collected in one run of profiling are limited by the GPU hardware resources. If too many counters or metrics are selected, the kernels need to be executed multiple times to collect them. For multi-pass execution, include multiple ``pmc`` rows in the input file. Counters or metrics in each ``pmc`` row can be collected in each application run.

The JSON and YAML files supports all the command line options and it can be used to configure both tracing and profiling. The input file has an array of profiling/tracing configurations called jobs. Each job is used to configure profiling/tracing for an application execution. The input schema of these files is given below.

Kernel profiling output
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To supply the input file for kernel profiling, use:

.. code-block:: shell

  rocprofv3 -i input.txt -- <app_relative_path>

Running the above command generates a `./pmc_n/counter_collection.csv` file prefixed with the process ID. For each ``pmc`` row, a directory ``pmc_n`` containing a `counter_collection.csv` file is generated, where n = 1 for the first row and so on.

In case of JSON or YAML input file, for each job, a directory ``pass_n`` containing a `counter_collection.csv` file is generated where n = 1...N jobs.

Each row of the CSV file is an instance of kernel execution. Here is a truncated version of the output file from ``pmc_1``:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat pmc_1/218_counter_collection.csv

Here are the contents of `counter_collection.csv` file:

.. csv-table:: Counter collection
   :file: /data/counter_collection.csv
   :widths: 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10
   :header-rows: 1

For the description of the fields in the output file, see :ref:`output-file-fields`.

Kernel Filtering
+++++++++++++++++

rocprofv3 supports kernel filtering in case of profiling. A kernel filter is a set of a regex string (to include the kernels matching this filter), a regex string (to exclude the kernels matching this filter),
and an iteration range (set of iterations of the included kernels). If the iteration range is not provided then all iterations of the included kernels are profiled.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat input.yml
   jobs:
    - pmc: [SQ_WAVES]
      kernel_include_regex: "divide"
      kernel_exclude_regex: ""
      kernel_iteration_range: "[1, 2, [5-8]]"

Agent info
++++++++++++

.. note::
  All tracing and counter collection options generate an additional `agent_info.csv` file prefixed with the process ID.

The `agent_info.csv` file contains information about the CPU or GPU the kernel runs on.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat 238_agent_info.csv

Kernel filtering
+++++++++++++++++

Kernel filtering allows you to filter the kernel profiling output based on the kernel name by specifying regex strings in the input file. To include kernel names matching the regex string in the kernel profiling output, use ``kernel_include_regex``. To exclude the kernel names matching the regex string from the kernel profiling output, use ``kernel_exclude_regex``.
You can also specify an iteration range for set of iterations of the included kernels. If the iteration range is not specified, then all iterations of the included kernels are profiled.

Here is an input file with kernel filters:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ cat input.yml
   jobs:
    - pmc: [SQ_WAVES]
      kernel_include_regex: "divide"
      kernel_exclude_regex: ""

To collect counters for the kernels matching the filters specified in the preceding input file, run:

.. code-block:: shell

  rocprofv3 -i input.yml -- <app_relative_path>

  $ cat pass_1/312_counter_collection.csv
  "Correlation_Id","Dispatch_Id","Agent_Id","Queue_Id","Process_Id","Thread_Id","Grid_Size","Kernel_Name","Workgroup_Size","LDS_Block_Size","Scratch_Size","VGPR_Count","SGPR_Count","Counter_Name","Counter_Value"

Output formats
----------------

``rocprofv3`` supports the following output formats:

- CSV (default)
- JSON
- PFTrace

You can specify the output format using the ``--output-format`` command-line option. Format selection is case-insensitive
and multiple output formats are supported. For example: ``--output-format json`` enables JSON output exclusively whereas
``--output-format csv json pftrace`` enables all three output formats for the run.

For trace visualization, use the PFTrace format and open the trace in `ui.perfetto.dev <https://ui.perfetto.dev/>`_.

JSON output schema
++++++++++++++++++++

``rocprofv3`` supports a custom JSON output format designed for programmatic analysis. The schema is optimized for size
while factoring in usability. You can generate the JSON output using ``--output-format json`` command-line option.
